                            <p>UI/UX & Interaction Design, 2017</p>
                            <p>Sports Lifestyle in Culture, SLIC, is a platform that gives a voice to athletes and superstars to communicate directly with their fans. Founded by former NBA All-Star, Baron Davis, SLIC develops premium, original content to showcase the real lifestyle of sports, entertainment, and music.

My objective in SLIC was to bring the product to life by designing a platform to house their original video content. Baron and I collaborated for 6 weeks to conceive a sleek, polished design that is now the home of SLIC.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="blog-thumbnail mb-70">
                            <img src="/img/bg-img/slic2.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog-content">
                            <span></span>
                            <p>
I got the ball rolling by jotting down every feature, idea, and element that Baron wanted the platform to harness. After many post-it brainstorms and white boarding, I began to wireframe these ideas, and determine their role within the app. Our goal was to give the app a unique feel that would outstep the boundaries that other media content apps had set.

We continued to hit one particular roadblock that we needed to address before moving forward with design— building a content platform that had very little content! </p>

                    <div class="blog-content">
                        <span></span>
                        <p  align="center">I took my low fidelity wireframes and brought them to life using Sketch. I began designing in grayscale because it simplifies the most complex element of visual design, and allowed me to focus on spacing and element layouts.

Each page, or channel, would have its own theme. I investigated the idea with simple gradients, and then began to mock up graphics to place beneath them to give it a bit of texture and depth.

                  <span></span>
                  <p  align="center">When designing a brand new product, understanding the zero data state is critical. The dilemma in this particular situation was: Given only five pieces of content, how can the platform look full and established?

                  I started plotting ideas to stretch the content as far as possible. I decided to separate each piece of content into its own page, or channel. These pages are represented by the circles, while the cards above it represent each episode within that channel. The infinite carousel of channels would allow the content to be seemingly endless.</p>
              </div>

          <div class="blog-thumbnail mb-70" align="center">
            <video width="440" height="480" autoplay="true" loop="infinite" align="center">
              <source src="/img/bg-img/slictv.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
              </video>
          </div>
          <div class="blog-content">
            <h6 align="center">This is a demonstration of a transition I created using Principle. I envisioned something smooth and subtle that would give SLIC a "slick" vibe.

            I used several drivers to construct this animation. I began by setting a drag animation to the channel carousel. I set the opacity of the headers, menu icon, and backgrounds to transition from 100% to 0% during the course of the animation.

            Next, I wanted the transition of the episode cards to feel a bit more natural — take notice that upon release of the drag, the initial cards fly off the screen creating a pretty cool shuffle effect.

            Lastly, I added a small touch to the channel carousel, by implementing a slight scale effect to emphasize the channel change (watch as the center circle contracts and expands).
